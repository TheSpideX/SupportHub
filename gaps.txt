Gaps in the Ideal Login Flow
After analyzing the current implementation, I've identified several gaps between the ideal authentication flow and the current implementation:

Security Gaps
Incomplete Device Fingerprinting
Current implementation uses basic device info
Missing advanced fingerprinting techniques like canvas fingerprinting or audio fingerprinting
No mechanism to detect browser anomalies or spoofing attempts
Limited Brute Force Protection
Account lockout exists but lacks progressive delays
IP-based rate limiting is implemented but not IP reputation scoring
No CAPTCHA integration for suspicious login attempts
Insufficient Audit Trail
Limited logging of authentication events
No comprehensive audit system for security investigations
Missing correlation between related security events
User Experience Gaps
Incomplete Error Handling
Generic error messages in some cases
Missing contextual guidance for specific error scenarios
No clear recovery paths for common authentication issues
Limited Multi-Device Awareness
New device detection exists but lacks comprehensive device management
No UI for viewing or managing active sessions across devices
Missing notifications for suspicious login attempts
Incomplete Offline Support
No clear offline authentication strategy
Missing queue mechanism for offline authentication attempts
Incomplete synchronization when coming back online
Technical Implementation Gaps
WebSocket Integration
Frontend not fully updated to work with WebSocket backend
Missing leader election mechanism for cross-tab coordination
Incomplete handling of WebSocket reconnection scenarios
Token Management
No clear token rotation strategy for long-lived sessions
Missing absolute maximum lifetime enforcement
Incomplete handling of clock drift between client and server
Cross-Tab Synchronization
No vector clock implementation for conflict resolution
Missing comprehensive state synchronization across tabs
Incomplete handling of race conditions during authentication
Compliance Gaps
Incomplete Consent Management
No clear mechanism for capturing and storing user consent
Missing version tracking for terms and privacy policy acceptance
Incomplete handling of consent withdrawal
Limited Privacy Controls
No clear mechanism for users to request data export
Missing functionality for users to delete their account
Incomplete handling of data minimization principles
Recommended Improvements
Enhanced Security
Implement progressive delays for failed login attempts
Add CAPTCHA for suspicious login patterns
Develop comprehensive security event logging
Improved User Experience
Create contextual error messages with clear recovery paths
Develop a device management UI for users
Implement notifications for security events
Technical Robustness
Complete WebSocket integration with leader election
Implement token rotation for long-lived sessions
Develop comprehensive cross-tab synchronization
Compliance Enhancements
Create consent management system
Implement privacy controls for users
Develop comprehensive audit trails
Addressing these gaps would create a more secure, user-friendly, and compliant authentication system that aligns with industry best practices.
