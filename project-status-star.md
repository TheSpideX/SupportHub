# SupportHub Project Status: STAR Framework

## Situation

- Developing a Technical Support CRM Portal from scratch over a 9-week timeline
- Built with React/Tailwind frontend and Node.js/Express/MongoDB backend
- Designed to streamline issue resolution for technical companies
- Currently in implementation phase with core features established
- **Key Differentiators**:
  - Unified login system with role-based UI routing
  - Enterprise-grade security with advanced authentication protections
  - Intelligent SLA management with automated escalation framework
  - Advanced multi-team collaboration for complex issue resolution

## Task

- Create a comprehensive ticket management system with role-based interfaces
- Implement SLA enforcement with automated alerts and escalation
- Develop real-time collaboration tools for support and technical teams
- Build organization-specific workflows with multi-team collaboration
- Ensure secure authentication with cross-tab/device synchronization
- Create a streamlined team member onboarding process using invitation codes

## Action

- **Completed:**

  - **Enterprise-grade Authentication System:**
    - HTTP-only cookies with JWT tokens for secure session management
    - Cross-tab synchronization with leader election mechanism
    - Brute force protection with account lockout after failed attempts
    - CSRF protection for all state-changing operations
    - Bcrypt password hashing with history tracking to prevent reuse
    - Suspicious activity detection with automated responses
  - Unified login system with intelligent role-based UI routing
  - Team invitation code generation for streamlined member registration
  - **Advanced Ticket & SLA System:**
    - Intelligent SLA management with priority-based policy application
    - Business hours calculation for realistic response times
    - Proactive monitoring with alerts at 75-80% of SLA expiry
