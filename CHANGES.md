## 2. Fixed SLA Reporting Endpoints

- Updated the ticket module index.js file to include the report routes
- Fixed the authentication middleware in the report routes to use the correct middleware
- Updated the route handlers to use the correct role-based access control middleware (`srs` instead of `authorizeRoles`)

## 3. Verified SLA Escalation Rules

- Created a test script (test_sla_escalation.py) to check the SLA escalation rules
- Verified that the SLA escalation rules are being applied correctly
