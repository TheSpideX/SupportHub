Frontend Update Strategy for WebSocket Authentication
Core Integration Approach
The frontend update will focus on leveraging the backend's WebSocket capabilities while maintaining a seamless user experience. Here's how we'll approach it:

1. Socket Connection Management
Current State:

Basic Socket.IO connection with limited error handling
No cross-tab coordination
Limited reconnection strategy
Update Strategy:

Implement a robust Socket Manager service that handles:
Connection lifecycle (connect, disconnect, reconnect)
Authentication state synchronization
Room management based on user hierarchy
Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
Connection sharing across tabs when appropriate
2. Leader Election Integration
Current State:

Frontend attempts to manage leader election
No integration with backend's leader election mechanism
Update Strategy:

Leverage backend's leader election system:
Listen for LEADER_ELECTED, LEADER_HEARTBEAT events
Respond to election requests from server
Track local tab's leader status based on server decisions
Implement priority reporting based on tab visibility/focus
Handle leadership transfers gracefully
3. Token Management
Current State:

HTTP-only cookies for token storage
Manual token refresh mechanism
Limited cross-tab coordination
Update Strategy:

Integrate with WebSocket token events:
Listen for TOKEN_UPDATED, TOKEN_EXPIRING events
Let leader tab handle token refresh via HTTP
Other tabs receive updates via WebSocket
Implement token state synchronization
Handle token invalidation events across all tabs
4. Cross-Tab Synchronization
Current State:

Basic BroadcastChannel implementation
Limited state synchronization
No conflict resolution
Update Strategy:

Leverage backend's state synchronization:
Implement vector clock support for conflict detection
Use server-side conflict resolution
Listen for STATE_UPDATE events
Send state updates through leader tab
Implement proper versioning for state updates
5. Room-Based Communication
Current State:

Limited understanding of room hierarchy
No targeted room events
Update Strategy:

Implement room-aware event handling:
Track joined rooms (user, device, session, tab)
Listen for room-specific events
Handle room updates and membership changes
Implement scoped event emission based on target room
6. Security Enhancements
Current State:

Basic security measures
Limited suspicious activity detection
Update Strategy:

Integrate with security events:
Listen for SECURITY_SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY events
Implement local security state tracking
Handle forced logout scenarios
Support password change notifications
Implement device verification flows
7. Offline Support
Current State:

Limited offline capabilities
No event queuing
Update Strategy:

Implement robust offline support:
Queue events during offline periods
Synchronize on reconnection
Maintain authentication state during offline periods
Handle clock drift between client and server
Support background token refresh via service worker
8. User Experience Improvements
Current State:

Limited feedback on connection status
Inconsistent authentication experience across tabs
Update Strategy:

Enhance user experience:
Provide real-time connection status indicators
Implement seamless authentication across tabs
Support silent authentication refreshes
Handle edge cases like tab hibernation
Provide clear error messages and recovery paths
9. Debugging and Monitoring
Current State:

Limited debugging capabilities
Update Strategy:

Leverage backend debugging tools:
Implement debug mode for development
Use room inspector for troubleshooting
Implement event logger for development
Support connection tracing
Add telemetry for authentication flows
Implementation Phases
