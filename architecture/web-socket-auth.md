# WebSocket Authentication System with Hierarchical Rooms

## System Architecture

### Room Hierarchy Design

```
Organization
    └── Team
        └── User
            └── Device
                └── Session
                    └── Tab
```

### Room Types & Purposes

1. **Organization Room** (`organization:{orgId}`)
   - Broadcasts organization-wide security events
   - Distributes policy updates and permission changes
   - Monitors active user counts and session statistics

2. **Team Room** (`team:{teamId}`)
   - Coordinates team-specific permission updates
   - Shares team activity and presence information
   - Distributes team-level notifications

3. **User Room** (`user:{userId}`)
   - Synchronizes user profile and permission changes
   - Broadcasts security events (password change, suspicious activity)
   - Tracks all active sessions for a single user

4. **Device Room** (`device:{deviceId}`)
   - Groups all tabs/sessions from a single device
   - Manages device verification status
   - Coordinates device-specific security policies

5. **Session Room** (`session:{sessionId}`)
   - Contains all tabs sharing the same authentication session
   - Distributes token expiration notifications
   - Synchronizes session timeout warnings

6. **Tab Room** (`tab:{tabId}`)
   - Individual browser tab instance
   - Handles tab-specific state and focus events
   - Manages tab-level activity tracking

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Server-Side Components

#### Room Manager Service
- **Room Registry**: Redis-backed registry of all active rooms
- **Hierarchy Maintenance**: Manages parent-child relationships
- **Room Metadata**: Stores capabilities and properties for each room
- **Access Control**: Enforces permission rules for room operations

#### Event Propagation Engine
- **Upward Propagation**: Events that need to notify parent rooms
- **Downward Propagation**: Events that should cascade to child rooms
- **Selective Propagation**: Events that target specific branches
- **Event Persistence**: Optional storage of events for offline clients

#### Authentication Integration
- **Socket Authentication Middleware**: Validates tokens on connection
- **Room Join Authorization**: Verifies permissions before joining rooms
- **Session Binding**: Links WebSocket connections to auth sessions
- **Token Refresh Notifications**: Proactive expiration warnings

### 2. Client-Side Components

#### Socket Connection Manager
- **Connection Lifecycle**: Handles connect, disconnect, reconnect
- **Authentication State**: Maintains token and session binding
- **Heartbeat Mechanism**: Ensures connection health
- **Backoff Strategy**: Exponential reconnect on failures

#### Room Subscription Handler
- **Room Discovery**: Determines appropriate rooms to join
- **Hierarchical Subscription**: Joins rooms in correct order
- **Room Metadata**: Tracks capabilities and state of each room
- **Event Routing**: Directs events to appropriate handlers

#### Cross-Tab Coordinator
- **Leader Election**: Designates primary tab for operations
- **State Synchronization**: Shares WebSocket state across tabs
- **Connection Sharing**: Optimizes WebSocket connections
- **Fallback Coordination**: Manages degraded operation modes

### 3. Authentication Events

#### Token Lifecycle Events
- **token:expiring**: Server notification of impending token expiration
- **token:refreshed**: Broadcast of successful token refresh
- **token:invalid**: Notification of token validation failure
- **token:revoked**: Immediate notification of forced token revocation

#### Session Lifecycle Events
- **session:activity**: Update of user activity timestamp
- **session:timeout_warning**: Notification of approaching session timeout
- **session:extended**: Confirmation of session extension
- **session:terminated**: Notification of session end

#### Security Events
- **security:password_changed**: Force re-authentication across all devices
- **security:suspicious_activity**: Alert of potential security concerns
- **security:device_verified**: Confirmation of new device verification
- **security:permission_changed**: Update to user permissions

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Set up Socket.IO with Redis adapter for horizontal scaling
2. Implement basic room structure (user, device, session, tab)
3. Create authentication middleware for socket connections
4. Develop room join/leave logic with basic authorization

### Phase 2: Token Integration
1. Implement token expiration monitoring service
2. Create WebSocket events for token lifecycle
3. Develop client-side token refresh based on notifications
4. Add cross-tab coordination for token operations

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Expand room hierarchy to include organization and team
2. Implement selective event propagation logic
3. Add room metadata and capabilities tracking
4. Develop leader election for optimized operations

### Phase 4: Resilience & Optimization
1. Implement offline event queuing and replay
2. Add connection sharing across tabs
3. Optimize event payload size with delta updates
4. Develop monitoring and analytics for WebSocket performance

## Security Considerations

### Connection Security
- **Transport Security**: WSS (WebSocket Secure) protocol only
- **Origin Validation**: Strict checking of connection origins
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against connection flooding
- **Payload Validation**: Schema validation for all events

### Authentication Security
- **Token Validation**: Verify token on connection and room join
- **Room Authorization**: Check permissions before allowing room subscription
- **Event Authorization**: Validate permissions for each event type
- **Namespace Isolation**: Separate authentication events from application events

### Data Protection
- **Minimal Payload**: Send only necessary data in events
- **No Sensitive Data**: Never send credentials or tokens in events
- **Encrypted Payloads**: Optional encryption for sensitive events
- **Sanitized Errors**: Prevent information leakage in error messages

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Performance Metrics
- **Connection Count**: Active connections per server
- **Room Size**: Number of connections per room
- **Message Rate**: Events per second by type and room
- **Latency**: Event delivery time measurements

### Debugging Tools
- **Room Inspector**: Admin tool to view room hierarchy and members
- **Event Logger**: Configurable logging of events for troubleshooting
- **Connection Tracer**: Track individual connection lifecycle
- **Replay Tool**: Reproduce event sequences for testing

This hierarchical WebSocket system provides a comprehensive solution for authentication state management, with efficient event propagation and robust security. The room-based architecture enables precise targeting of notifications while maintaining the scalability needed for large applications.
