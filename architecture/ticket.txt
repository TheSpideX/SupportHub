also we have to use websocket for these, do we use a single one or more than one

Augment
WebSocket Strategy for Ticket System
Recommendation: Multiple Namespaced WebSockets
Based on the existing WebSocket infrastructure in your codebase, I recommend using multiple namespaced WebSockets rather than a single WebSocket connection:

Proposed WebSocket Structure
Main Ticket Namespace (/tickets)
Handles general ticket updates and notifications
Manages dashboard real-time updates
Broadcasts system-wide announcements
Collaboration Namespace (/tickets/collaboration)
Dedicated to real-time collaboration features
Manages presence indicators (who's viewing a ticket)
Handles comment typing indicators
Supports @mentions notifications
SLA Namespace (/tickets/sla)
Focused on time-sensitive SLA notifications
Delivers alerts for approaching deadlines
Broadcasts immediate notifications for SLA breaches
Admin Namespace (/tickets/admin)
Provides real-time system metrics
Delivers configuration change notifications
Supports admin-only broadcasts
Rationale
Separation of Concerns
Each namespace handles specific functionality
Easier to maintain and debug
Allows for targeted scaling of high-traffic namespaces
Performance Optimization
Reduces unnecessary message broadcasting
Users only connect to relevant namespaces
Decreases payload sizes for common updates
Security Benefits
Granular access control per namespace
Role-based connection restrictions
Isolated admin communications
Alignment with Existing Architecture
Follows the pattern established in your session WebSocket implementation
Leverages your existing Redis adapter for horizontal scaling
Compatible with your current Socket.IO configuration
This approach will integrate seamlessly with your existing WebSocket infrastructure while providing the necessary real-time capabilities for the ticket system.

we will have to make a namspace for team lead for different group and also for their memeber

Augment
Revised WebSocket Namespace Strategy
Enhanced Team-Based WebSocket Structure
Based on your requirement for team-specific communication, here's the revised WebSocket namespace strategy:

Core Namespaces
Main Ticket Namespace (/tickets)
General ticket updates and notifications
System-wide announcements
Global dashboard updates
SLA Namespace (/tickets/sla)
Time-sensitive SLA notifications
Deadline alerts
Priority escalation broadcasts
Team-Based Namespaces
Team Namespace (/tickets/teams/:teamId)
Team-specific ticket updates
Team announcements
Team workload distribution updates
Team performance metrics
Team Lead Namespace (/tickets/teams/:teamId/lead)
Restricted to team leads only
Team management notifications
Resource allocation updates
Performance alerts for team members
Workload balancing suggestions
Team Member Namespace (/tickets/teams/:teamId/members/:memberId)
Individual member notifications
Personal workload updates
Direct assignments
Performance feedback
Collaboration Namespaces
Ticket Collaboration Namespace (/tickets/:ticketId/collaboration)
Real-time collaboration on specific tickets
Presence indicators
Typing indicators
Live comment updates
Admin Namespace (/tickets/admin)
System metrics and health
Configuration changes
Cross-team management
Implementation Benefits
Hierarchical Organization
Clear namespace hierarchy reflects organizational structure
Intuitive routing of messages
Simplified access control
Targeted Communication
Team leads receive only relevant team information
Team members get personalized updates
Reduces noise and information overload
Scalability Advantages
Independent scaling for high-traffic namespaces
Team isolation prevents system-wide congestion

Role-based namespace access
Team data isolation
Privileged communication channels for leads
This revised structure accommodates the team lead and member-specific requirements while maintaining the benefits of a multi-namespace approach, aligning with your existing WebSocket infrastructure.

what should be our idea approach for this

Augment
Ideal WebSocket Approach for Ticket System
Recommended Implementation Strategy
Based on your existing codebase and requirements, here's the ideal approach for implementing WebSockets in your ticket system:

/tickets                       (Global ticket events)
├── /tickets/sla               (SLA notifications)
├── /tickets/teams/:teamId     (Team-specific events)
│   ├── /lead                  (Team lead channel)
│   └── /members/:memberId     (Individual member channel)
└── /tickets/:ticketId         (Ticket-specific collaboration)

2. Connection Management
Single Socket Connection: Maintain one physical Socket.IO connection per client
Multiple Room Subscriptions: Use Socket.IO rooms instead of multiple connections
Dynamic Room Joining: Join/leave rooms based on user context (viewing ticket, team changes)
3. Authentication & Security
Leverage your existing token-based authentication system
Implement middleware for namespace access control
Use your Redis adapter for secure room isolation
4. Event Standardization
Define consistent event naming conventions
Standardize payload structures across all ticket events
Implement versioned event schemas for backward compatibility
5. Implementation Phases
Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

Set up the /tickets namespace
Implement basic ticket update broadcasting
Establish authentication middleware
Phase 2: Team Communication

Add team-specific namespaces
Implement role-based access control
Set up team lead channels
Phase 3: Real-time Collaboration

Add ticket-specific collaboration features
Implement presence indicators
Add typing notifications
Phase 4: Advanced Features

Implement SLA real-time alerts
Add performance metrics streaming
Optimize for scale
6. Technical Considerations
Redis Adapter: Continue using your existing Redis adapter for horizontal scaling
Room Management: Implement efficient room cleanup for inactive sessions
Heartbeat: Extend your current heartbeat mechanism to all ticket namespaces
Error Handling: Standardize error responses across all ticket events
7. Client Implementation
Create a dedicated TicketSocketService extending your current socket implementation
Implement room management on the client side
Add reconnection logic with event replay
This approach:

Maximizes reuse of your existing WebSocket infrastructure
Provides clear separation of concerns
Scales efficiently for your projected 5,000+ monthly tickets
Maintains security through your established authentication patterns
Supports all required real-time features while minimizing complexity
The key advantage is using Socket.IO rooms within fewer namespaces rather than creating excessive namespaces, which aligns with Socket.IO best practices while meeting all your requirements.

we will be making room instead of seperate connections

Augment
Optimized Room-Based WebSocket Approach
Implementation Strategy
Using Socket.IO rooms instead of separate connections is the ideal approach. Here's how to implement it:

1. Simplified Namespace Structure
/tickets  (Single namespace for all ticket-related communication)

2. Room Hierarchy

tickets:global                       (System-wide announcements)
tickets:sla                          (SLA notifications)
tickets:team:{teamId}                (Team-specific events)
tickets:team:{teamId}:lead           (Team lead communications)
tickets:team:{teamId}:member:{userId} (Individual member events)
tickets:ticket:{ticketId}            (Specific ticket updates)
tickets:ticket:{ticketId}:viewers    (Active viewers/collaborators)
tickets:admin                        (Admin-only communications)

3. Connection Management
Single Connection: Each client maintains one WebSocket connection
Dynamic Room Membership: Clients join/leave rooms based on:
User role and permissions
Current view/context
Team membership
Active ticket collaboration
4. Implementation Details
Backend:

Extend your existing RoomManager.js to handle ticket-specific rooms
Leverage your existing room hierarchy propagation methods
Use your established Redis adapter for distributed room management
Frontend:

Create a TicketSocketService extending your current socket implementation
Implement automatic room joining based on user context
Add event listeners for room-specific events
5. Key Advantages
Resource Efficiency
Single connection reduces overhead
Minimizes connection management complexity
Lower server memory footprint
Simplified Architecture
