# Physical View - Technical Support CRM Portal

## Deployment Architecture

### 1. Client Tier
- **Web Browsers**: Modern browsers accessing the application
- **Technologies**:
  - React.js with Framer Motion for animations
  - TailwindCSS for styling
  - Redux for state management

### 2. Application Tier
- **Web Server**:
  - **Technology**: Nginx (Reverse Proxy)
  - **Responsibility**: Load balancing, SSL termination, static content serving

- **Application Server**:
  - **Technology**: Node.js with Express.js
  - **Responsibility**: API endpoints, business logic, authentication
  - **Deployment**: Docker containers managed by PM2
  - **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling through container orchestration

- **WebSocket Server**:
  - **Technology**: Socket.io
  - **Responsibility**: Real-time notifications and updates
  - **Integration**: Redis for pub/sub across multiple instances

- **Task Queue**:
  - **Technology**: BullMQ with Redis
  - **Responsibility**: Background processing, scheduled tasks, SLA monitoring

### 3. Data Tier
- **Primary Database**:
  - **Technology**: MongoDB (locally hosted)
  - **Data**: Users, tickets, teams, comments, notifications
  - **Optimization**: Indexed collections for performance

- **Caching Layer**:
  - **Technology**: Redis
  - **Data**: Session data, frequently accessed information
  - **Purpose**: Reduce database load, improve response times

- **File Storage**:
  - **Technology**: Local file system (initial phase)
  - **Data**: Ticket attachments, user avatars
  - **Future**: Potential migration to cloud storage

## Network Architecture

### Internal Network
- Secure communication between application components
- Firewall protection for database access
- Load balancing for horizontal scaling

### External Network
- HTTPS for all client-server communication
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- DDoS protection

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless application servers for easy replication
- Redis for shared state across instances
- Load balancing for request distribution

### Vertical Scaling
- Database optimization through indexing
- Efficient query patterns
- Resource monitoring and allocation

## Security Architecture

### Authentication Layer
- JWT-based authentication
- Secure password storage with bcrypt
- Session management via Redis

### Authorization Layer
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Permission verification middleware
- Data access restrictions

### Data Protection
- CSRF protection
- Input validation
- Rate limiting
- Data encryption for sensitive information

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Logging
- Centralized logging system
- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance metrics collection

### Backup Strategy
- Regular database backups
- Disaster recovery procedures
- Data retention policies

## Deployment Pipeline

### Development Environment
- Local development setup with Docker Compose
- Hot reloading for rapid iteration

### Testing Environment
- Automated testing with Jest, Supertest
- Integration tests for critical paths

### Production Environment
- Deployment via CI/CD pipeline
- Blue-green deployment for zero downtime updates
- Render for cloud hosting
